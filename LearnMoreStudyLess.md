Learn More, Study Less!

here are some words from Marvin Minsky:

"If you understand something in only one way, then you don't really understand it at all. The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to all other things we know. Well-connected representations let you turn ideas around in your mind, to envision things from many perspectives until you find one that works for you. And that's what we mean by thinking!"

Introduction

    What makes somebody smart? Is it raw brainpower? Accumulated knowledge? Is it just academic learning or does it also include your experiences, people skills and intuition?

    I prefer to avoid universal definitions (of intelligence) and focus on a more practical one: Being smart means being able to learn quickly, remember a large amount of information and be able to sort that information in a way that achieves your goals.

    Learning goals can differ from person to person. You might just want to get A's in all your courses. John might want to become a master at computer programming. Susan might want to retain more from the books she reads in her spare time. Another person might want to be able to apply concepts to business situations.

    It's up to you to decide what being smart means.

    holistic learning

    My hope is to provide a large assortment of tools that, with the backing of the holistic learning strategy, you can use to tailor your own approach.

    This book has two major goals. First, the holistic learning strategy should give you a model for how to learn better. By seeing the holistic learning strategy you have a basis for identifying your weaknesses and improving the way you learn. The second objective of this book is to provide a variety of learning techniques.

    Without an easily understandable theory of learning, it is difficult to make improvements.



My Story

    Self-learning has also occupied my time. I've taught myself several programming languages, business and writing skills and my bookshelf has hundreds of books I've read in just the past two years. I've also dabbled in graphic design, musical composition and anything I could get my hands on.

    Up until this point, I'd just be another smart kid. "Gifted" might fit as well, although there are people whose mental feats would put my small achievements to shame. I'd be just another kid who got a more favorable genetic cocktail, had pushy parents or some sort of glandular accident.

    And if you read this far, you could probably slap on arrogant and boastful.

    Smarts requires a different strategy. Smart people had picked up different tactics. It was these different strategies that made the difference in understanding.

    The different strategy I called holistic learning. I call it holistic learning because it challenges you to view learning as a comprehensive whole, instead of a list of memorized facts.

    Smart people tend to make fewer distinctions between branches of knowledge and can easily relate one set of understandings to another.

    By learning holistically, smart people are able to quickly integrate new information. More importantly, this information sticks. They actuallly "get" the concepts and see how the concepts relate to far more than just the problems given.

    This student didn't just know how to get the answer. He also understood the entire scope for which the problem existed. Instead of seeing the problem in the same terms he had been taught, he could easily view it a number of ways.

    The goal of holistic learning is to replicate this process with the information you want to learn.



How to Use This Book
    
    These techniques can't rest just within an academic setting.

    holistic learning needs to encompass anything you want to understand. The more broadly you can apply these methods, the better they function as a tool for increasing your understanding.

    You'll get the best results if you focus on learning only one skill at a time.

    

#Part 1: The Holistic Learning Strategy

What is Holistic Learning?

    Holistic learning is opposite of rote memorization.

    Holistic learning takes a different approach. Instead of trying to memorize information by making a perfect copy in your brain, it uses the web of neurons you have.

    Holistic learning creates webs of information. One idea relates to another idea.

    That interrelating of ideas allows you to easily navigate through complete understandings.

    Learning anything requires associations. The more associations you can create and the stronger those associations are, the better.

    Learning doesn't fit into boxes. Learning fits into webs.

    Holistic learners connect everything.

    When you don't know the steps learning should follow and lack techniques to move through those steps, simply pounding information in your skull seems to work.

    Holistic learning is based on three main ideas: Constructs; Models; Highways.

    Holistic learning is based on linking ideas as a way of remembering and applying them. The best techniques to start learning are metaphor, visceralization, flow-based notetaking and diagraming. These methods form the foundation of holistic learning.
