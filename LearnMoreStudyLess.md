Learn More, Study Less!

by Scott Young(I have no idea who he is)

here are some words from Marvin Minsky:

"If you understand something in only one way, then you don't really understand it at all. The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to all other things we know. Well-connected representations let you turn ideas around in your mind, to envision things from many perspectives until you find one that works for you. And that's what we mean by thinking!"

Introduction

    What makes somebody smart? Is it raw brainpower? Accumulated knowledge? Is it just academic learning or does it also include your experiences, people skills and intuition?

    I prefer to avoid universal definitions (of intelligence) and focus on a more practical one: Being smart means being able to learn quickly, remember a large amount of information and be able to sort that information in a way that achieves your goals.

    Learning goals can differ from person to person. You might just want to get A's in all your courses. John might want to become a master at computer programming. Susan might want to retain more from the books she reads in her spare time. Another person might want to be able to apply concepts to business situations.

    It's up to you to decide what being smart means.

    holistic learning

    My hope is to provide a large assortment of tools that, with the backing of the holistic learning strategy, you can use to tailor your own approach.

    This book has two major goals. First, the holistic learning strategy should give you a model for how to learn better. By seeing the holistic learning strategy you have a basis for identifying your weaknesses and improving the way you learn. The second objective of this book is to provide a variety of learning techniques.

    Without an easily understandable theory of learning, it is difficult to make improvements.
