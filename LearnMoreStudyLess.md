Learn More, Study Less!

by Scott Young(I have no idea who he is)



here are some words from Marvin Minsky:

"If you understand something in only one way, then you don't really understand it at all. The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to all other things we know. Well-connected representations let you turn ideas around in your mind, to envision things from many perspectives until you find one that works for you. And that's what we mean by thinking!"
